Hey there!

Webcomic Checker is exactly what it sounds like: a tool to check webcomics. If you
read enough of them, you know that there are more then a couple comics out there
with inconsistent update schedules. You could just keep them open in a browser and
check them periodically (which is what I did for a period of time), but such a
simple repetitive task is exactly the kind of thing you should automate!

Before doing anything, run install.py . It'll install two packages, requests and
beautifulsoup4 on your machine. Then, run main.py to run the program.
More information on how to use this program will be made available upon running it.

This tool isn't anything impressive, I wrote it mostly to teach myself a couple
things. Still, I hope you can find some use for it.
